## Main algorithms of classical machine learning:

1. Linear models:
   - Linear Regression
   - Logistic Regression
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

2. Metric algorithms:
   - k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN)

3. Decision Trees

4. Ensembles:
   - Bagging
   - Random Forest
   - Boosting with decision trees

5. Clustering:
   - K-means
   - Agglomerative Clustering

6. Dimensionality reduction:
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   - Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)

## In addition to that, the repository will include the following functionalities:
- Loss functions for classification and regression
- Quality metrics for classification and regression
- Various regularization techniques
- Stochastic gradient descent
